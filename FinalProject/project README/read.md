Hello cs50 staff,

My name is Ayaan Ahmed, I live in the city of Dhaka in the country of Bangladesh. I have enrolled into the cs50x 2020 course for over half a year now. This is my Final Project.

I have named this game "JumpMania" and the language I have used to make this game is with "lua". The game is run with the game software "LOVE". The version in which I have tested this game is in version 11.3. If there are complications to run the game, you may update the version to your current LOVE version by going to the conf.lua source file and changing the "t.version". The game is a simple mario-style 16-bit pixel game. It may look simple and short but it took about 4-5 days worth of typing code and researching about lua. You can jump, double-jump, move left and right, collect coins and even recieve damage from spikes and the enemy monster. It is controlled using the arrow keys or "wasd" on the keyboard.

I hope my final project is satisfactory and that I get receive my verified certificate, which I have worked hard for quite a long time.

Sincerely,

Ayaan Ahmed
